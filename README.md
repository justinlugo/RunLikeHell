# RunLikeHell
(Fall 2021)<br>For this project, I had to create a dynamic algorithm that would determine the maximum possible combination of non-consecutive integers in an array. I did this by drawing out a diagram to come up with the logic, and then convert that into code, further translating it to a dynamically recursive function.
